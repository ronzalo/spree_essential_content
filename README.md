# Spree Essential Content [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/FineLineAutomation/spree_essential_content.png)](http://travis-ci.org/FineLineAutomation/spree_essential_content)

Spree Essential Content is a fully featured CMS with pages, contents, images and more. It has a blog complete with archives, categories, tags and related products. base for many content related extensions for Spree. It also provides an asset-upload interface.

This is a fork of the excellent spree_essentials gem by @citrus. The changes to the gem are:

* Use rspec and spree's native test_app rake task instead of Test:Unit and dummier
* No longer including the markdown editor. It's easier to use the spree_editor gem and set up a rich text editor like TinyMCE.
* We have merged all the spree_essential gems into this one. Since many people actually install all 3 gems to begin with, there is no need to continue to keep them seperate. This decision was made in the interest of maintainability.

## Installation

If you don't already have an existing Spree site, [click here](https://github.com/spree/spree) then come back later... You can also read the Spree docs [here](http://spreecommerce.com/documentation/getting_started.html)...

Spree Essential Content can be installed by itself by adding the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'globalize', github: 'globalize/globalize'
gem 'spree_i18n', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_i18n'
gem 'spree_globalize', github: 'spree-contrib/spree_globalize', branch: 'master'

gem 'spree_essential_content', github: 'ronzalo/spree_essential_content', branch: 'globalized'
```

If you are using a version of spree lower than 2.4, please see one of the stable branches for the right version of this gem. Please also note I am not maintaining anything below Spree 2.3 now.

Then run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Once that's complete, run the migration generator and migrate your database:

Now run the generator to install the extension.

```bash
rails g spree_essential_content:install
```

Then migrate your database:

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

If that all went smoothly, you should be ready to boot the server with:

```bash
rails s
```

Now login to the admin and click on the 'Content' tab!
